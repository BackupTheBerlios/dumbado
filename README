== What is dumbado?

dumbado is a program that captures packets transmitted over the network, 
(AKA packet sniffer) and stores statistics based on them for analysis
or debugging.  

dumbado is based on the libpcap Library and therefore supports the same
rich filtering expressions that programs like 'tcpdump' support.

It's tested to compile under Debian Testing/Squeeze 32-64 bits with
2.6.32-5 kernel. It has not been tested on any other platform. 

This third version 0.3 of dumbado features new  graphic user interface
and analyzes packets until OSI transport layer.
Deeper analisis expected on further releases.


== Dependencies

dumbado depends on libpcap Library. It should be installed on the
system for the program to work.


== Installation

See INSTALL file for details. 
  
  
== Basic usage:

  Check documentation at http://developer.berlios.de/docman/index.php?group_id=12123


== Security Implications

dumbado needs to be executed as root user. Be aware of the obvious 
security implications of doing so. Use it at your own risk.

In the wrong hands this program can be used to monitor unauthorised networks.
I have chosen to release it anyway, because crackers already have tools
specifically optimized for doing "evil" network sniffing easily, 
and this program will most likely not make their lives any easier.
