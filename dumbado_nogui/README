== What is dumbado?

dumbado is a program that captures packets transmitted over the network, 
(AKA packet sniffer) and stores statistics based on them for analysis
or debugging.  

dumbado is based on the libpcap Library and therefore supports the same
rich filtering expressions that programs like 'tcpdump' support.

It's tested to compile under Debian Testing/Squeeze 64 bits with
2.6.32-5-amd64 kernel. It has not been tested on any other platform. 

This first version of dumbado, called dumbado_nogui, 
it's just a concept release and lacks graphical user's interface.
Hopefully, it will be provided on next releases.


== Dependencies

dumbado depends on libpcap Library. It should be installed on the
system for the program to work.


== Installation

See INSTALL file for details. Anyway, you can compile dumbado_nogui.c using
the command line (linking against libpcap Libraries):
  gcc -Wall dumbado_nogui.c -lpcap -o dumbado_nogui
  
  
== Basic usage:

  dumbado_nogui <interface> <number_of_packets> <"filter string">
  
  +Interface: your network interface
  +number_of_packets: how many packets you want to capture.
  +filter string: filter in bpf (Berkeley Packet Filter) format.
  More information about bpf syntax at http://biot.com/capstats/bpf.html


== Security Implications

dumbado needs to be executed as root user. Be aware of the obvious 
security implications of doing so. Use it at your own risk.

In the wrong hands this program can be used to monitor unauthorised networks.
I have chosen to release it anyway, because crackers already have tools
specifically optimized for doing "evil" network sniffing easily, 
and this program will most likely not make their lives any easier.
